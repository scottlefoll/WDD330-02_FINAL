<!-- Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code. Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.

Core Requirements
 Build a 3X3 board in HTML and CSS.
You could do this with either a table element, or a collection of divs. Both have their advantages and disadvantages.

 Attach a touchend listener to the board.
When a cell is touched it should add either an 'X or an 'O', depending on whether it is player 1 or player 2's turn.

 Add a reset button.
When touched the reset button should remove all of the marks from the board.

Stretch Goals
 If your board looks like the first image below...make it look like the second.
Borders all around the outside, incorrect
Incorrect borders
Onlt borders on the inside, correct
Correct borders
Hint: look into :nth-child(n), :last-child, etc for help to target specific cells to turn borders on or off.

 Add Game logic
Right now the players have to decide who won, or whether it was a tie. Add some game logic to figure out when the game should result in a tie.

 Add More Game logic
